- Solve the classification task defined in Module 1 (or define new ones) with the other classification methods analyzed during the course: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Ensemble Methods, Gradient Boosting Machines.

- Always perform hyper-parameter tuning phases and justify your choices (which are the best parameters? which parameters did you test and why?).

- Evaluate each classifier with the techniques presented in DM1: accuracy (or precision, recall, F1-score etc), ROC curve (or lift, precision-recall etc).

- Besides the numerical evaluation draw your conclusions about the various classifiers (e.g. for Neural Networks: what are the parameter sets or the convergence criteria which avoid overfitting? For Ensemble classifiers how the number of base models impact the classification performance? What is revealing the feature importance of Random Forests?)
