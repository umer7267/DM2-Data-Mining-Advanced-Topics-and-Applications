- Define one simple unbalanced classification tasks and solve it with Decision Tree or KNN.

- If the dataset is already unbalanced leave it as it is, otherwise turns the dataset into an imbalanced version (e.g., 96% - 4%, for binary classification).

- Then solve the classification task using the Decision Tree or KNN by adopting at least 2 techniques of imbalanced learning (Undersampling, Oversampling).
