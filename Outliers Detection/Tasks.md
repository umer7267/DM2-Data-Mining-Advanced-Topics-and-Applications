- Identify the top 1% outliers: adopt at least three different methods from different families (e.g., density-based, angle-basedâ€¦) and compare the results.

- Visualize the outliers in a 2 or 3d scatter plot using at least one dimensionality reduction technique. (Done in next module)

- Deal with the outliers in a way you see fit, e.g. by removing them from the dataset or by treating the anomalous variables as missing values and employing replacement techniques. In this second case, you should check that the outliers are not outliers anymore. Justify your choices in every step.
