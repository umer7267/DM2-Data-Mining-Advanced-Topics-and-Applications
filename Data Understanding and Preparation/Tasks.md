## Data Understanding and Preparation

Explore and prepare the dataset. You are allowed to take inspiration from existing notebooks you can find online and figure out your personal research perspective (from choosing a subset of variables to the class to predictâ€¦). You are welcome in creating new variables and performing all the pre-processing steps the dataset needs.
