## Data Understanding and Preparation
- Explore and prepare the time series dataset.
- Preprocess the dataset in order to be able to run time series clustering; motif/anomaly discovery and classification. If the dataset is too big for these tasks, you can use approximations (e.g. SAX, PAA etc)

## Motifs/Discords
- Analyze the dataset for finding motifs and/or anomalies. Visualize and discuss them and their relationship with shapelets.

## Clustering
- Use at least two clustering algorithms on time series using an appropriate distance.
- Analyze the clusters and highlight similarities and differences and visualize the clusters using at least 2 dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Classification
Define one (or more) classification tasks and solve them using:
- KNN with at least two distances
  - Euclidean/Manhattan
  - DTW
- Shapelets
  - Analyze the shapelets retrieved
- At least one other method (rocket, muse, CNN, RNN etc)
